# IEEE-123 Voltage Profile Example

This example illustrates how to use GridLAB-D to download and solve the IEEE-123 model and output a plot of the voltage profile that can be downloaded for viewing.

To view the output, select [Actions](https://github.com/dchassin/gridlabd-example-ieee123-voltage-profile/actions) to show the most recent simulation runs. Select the most recent run completed and download the artifact named `profile.png`.

## How it works

The gridlabd simulation is started by the file [.github/workflows/main.yml](main/.github/workflows/main.yml).
